A **hamburger menu** is a type of graphical user interface element typically used in web and mobile applications to toggle a menu or navigation panel. It gets its name from the three horizontal lines that resemble a hamburger (with the lines representing the top bun, meat, and bottom bun).

### Description:
The hamburger menu icon is a minimalistic design choice that is often placed in the top left or right corner of a screen. When clicked or tapped, it reveals a hidden navigation menu or options panel. This allows for a cleaner and more streamlined interface by hiding the menu until it's needed, saving valuable screen space. It's commonly used in responsive web design and mobile apps, where space is at a premium.
